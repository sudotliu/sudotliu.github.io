I technically started this blog many years ago but never made the time to post meaningful content.
Now that AI is here to help and I have far more experience under my belt, it feels like a great time
to have a place to journal my thoughts on tech and perhaps share some of my past work in more detail
than can fit on a résumé.

It feels appropriate to dedicate this first post to the key technologies enabling its existence:
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- ["Minimal Mistakes" theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)
- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- HTML, CSS, JS (of course!)
- Your favorite domain registrar (optional)

It's worth noting that this setup is not exactly user-friendly, especially for anyone new to tech,
but it can also be run for free (minus the cost of custom domain) if you're okay with having its
contents be publicly accessible on GitHub. You can also pay a GitHub subscription to enable
privatizing the contents.

If you're strictly looking to blog with a well-supported, feature-full editor, I can't really
recommend this route, but if you're curious about tech at all and want to have your own (static)
website for whatever purpose, it's never too late to learn!

Until next time, happy hacking!
