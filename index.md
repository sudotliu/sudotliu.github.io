Welcome to my blog that will mostly be focused on technology, especially code.

I am a simple guy with deep fondness for technology. I've always been driven by a
desire to discover how things work, and that inquisitive nature will probably never be fully
satisfied. It took me some time to find my niche among the various fields and career paths that
piqued my interest, and although I started as a mechanical engineering major, I didn't find true
academic passion until I switched to computer science. While I still admire all kinds of
engineering, I'm now convinced that I was meant to create software.

Despite the many frustrations and long nights, my enthusiasm for code remains as strong as when I
ran my first "Hello, World!" program. Finding my calling has been invigorating, and I realize that I
have the potential to significantly impact how people live, right at my fingertips. Given this, I am
proud to be a techie who aims to make the world a better place, clich√© as it may sound.
